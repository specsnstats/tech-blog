## Project Description:

Deployed Website: 
The Tech Blog is designed for users to create accounts and make blog posts which other users can read, comment on, etc


## Installation Guide:
No installation is required for this application! simply direct yourself to the Heroku website and begin using it!

## Usage Information:
You are first taken to the main page, where recent posts made by others will appear. You can then click on the "Login" button to be sent to the login page. 

Start by creating a Username and Password, then you will be taken to your Profile, where you can create posts, delete posts, and comment on posts you have made

## Contribution Guidelines:
For now, we only have the Login portion of the application done. We would like to have all the other functionality set up, such as creating blog posts, having blog posts you have made appear in the profile page, and have them simultaneously display on the front page.
